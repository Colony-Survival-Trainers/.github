# **Colony Survival Trainer**

Torches glow along wooden walls. Colonists murmur, carrying grain and hope in equal measure.
In *Colony Survival*, progress is patient—measured in days survived, walls raised, and routines refined. And sometimes, you want to *observe* the system without the constant pressure of collapse.

The **Colony Survival Trainer** is built for those moments.
Not to replace strategy—but to **slow the storm**, letting you study, plan, and grow with intention.
